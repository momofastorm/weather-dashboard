USER STORY: AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

This Weather App is a simple application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions and a five-day forecast for any location. Additionally, the app stores the user's previous search locations, allowing for easy access to frequently searched places.

How to Use
To use the app, simply type in the location you want to search for in the search bar and hit enter or click the search button. The app will display the current weather conditions as well as a five-day forecast for that location.

If you want to view the weather for a previously searched location, simply click on the location from the list of previous searches. The app will display the weather information for that location.

Technologies Used
This Weather App was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The weather data is retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The app uses localStorage to store the user's previous search locations. This allows the user to easily access their frequently searched locations without having to re-enter the search term every time they use the app.
